# B+ Tree Implementation (C++)

This project is an implementation of the **B+ Tree** data structure in C++.  
It supports basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and search.  

Currently, only the header file and project report are uploaded.  
The `.cpp` implementation and test code will be added later after refactoring.
